    "### Problem Statement 1:\n",
    "Blood glucose levels for obese patients have a mean of 100 with a standard deviation of 15. \n",
    "\n",
    "A researcher thinks that a diet high in raw cornstarch will have a positive effect on\n",
    "blood glucose levels. A sample of 36 patients who have tried the raw cornstarch diet\n",
    "have a mean glucose level of 108. Test the hypothesis that the raw cornstarch had an\n",
    "effect or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution:- Follow the above discussed steps to test this hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step-1: State the hypotheses. The population mean is 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "H0: μ= 100\n",
    "H1: μ > 100\n",
    "\n",
    "Step-2: Set up the significance level. It is not given in the problem so let’s assume it as 5% (0.05).\n",
    "\n",
    "Step-3: Compute the random chance probability using z score and z-table.\n",
    "\n",
    "__ _ z = (x - mean)/(standard deviation/sqrt(36)) _ __\n",
    "\n",
    "For this set of data: z= (108-100) / (15/√36)=3.20\n",
    "\n",
    "You can look at the probability by looking at z- table and p-value associated with 3.20 is 0.9993 i.e. probability of having value less than 108 is 0.9993 and more than or equals to 108 is (1-0.9993)=0.0007.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step-4: It is less than 0.05 so we will reject the Null hypothesis i.e. there is raw cornstarch effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Setting significance level can also be done using z-value known as critical value. Find out the z- value of 5% probability and it is 1.65 (positive or negative, in any direction). Now we can compare calculated z-value with critical value to make a decision."
